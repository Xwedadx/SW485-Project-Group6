Project Motivation:

Stroke is among the major causes of deaths and long-term disabilities globally. Early risk prediction of stroke would greatly improve the outcomes in patients by allowing timely medical interventions. The motivation of this project is to use machine learning techniques in analyzing health-related factors and to predict the occurrence of a stroke. By working with this dataset, we try to develop a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk.

The key goal of this dataset is to present stroke prediction abilities using health parameters. It offers machine learning models the ability to predict the   likelihood of a stroke based on input features like age, hypertension, heart disease, and smoker status.

Objective of Collecting This Dataset:
This dataset has been gathered to support the research process involved in predictive health analytics. 
Primary objectives include the following:
1. Medical Decision Support: Helping doctors and healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions regarding stroke prevention.
2. Risk Factor Analysis: Understanding how different health parameters contribute to stroke occurrence.
3. Machine Learning Applications: Training and evaluating classification models for stroke prediction.

The Stroke Prediction Dataset, which is accessible on Kaggle, consists of 5,110 records with 11 attributes pertaining to patient demographics and medical data. Based on these input values, the dataset is intended to forecast the probability that a patient will have a stroke.

Information about Attributes:
1. id: A special number assigned to every patient.
The gender of the patient is indicated by the categorical variable "Male," "Female," or "Other."
3. age: The patient's age expressed as a numerical value.
4. Hypertension: This variable is binary, with 0 denoting that the patient has no hypertension and 1 denoting that they do.
The binary variable heart_disease has a value of 1 if the patient has a heart disease and 0 if the patient has no heart disease.
5. ever_married: A categorical variable that returns "No" or "Yes" depending on whether the patient has ever been married.
6. work_type: A categorical variable that indicates whether the patient is self-employed, private, never-worked, "children," or "Govt_job."
7. Residence_type: A categorical variable that indicates whether the patient lives in an urban or rural area.
8. avg_glucose_level: A numerical value that indicates the patient's blood glucose average.
9. BMI: The patient's body mass index, expressed as a numerical value.
10. smoking_status: This variable is a categorical one that indicates whether the patient smokes or not. It can be "formerly smoked," "never smoked," "smokes," or "Unknown" (where "Unknown" indicates that the patient's information is unavailable).
11. stroke: This is a binary target variable, with 1 denoting a stroke and 0 denoting no stroke.
This dataset is useful for creating machine learning models that forecast the incidence of strokes based on a variety of demographic and health characteristics. Studies concentrating on predictive modeling and the identification of important risk factors for stroke have made use of it.
