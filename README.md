Motivation for the Project:

Stroke is a long-standing cause of disability worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)It is the second leading cause of death, responsible for approximately 11% of global deaths. Early detection and preventive measures can significantly improve short-term patient outcomes

In this regard, this project aims at applying machine learning approaches to find out associated risk factors for stroke. This dataset contains promising patient specific factors such as age, sex, medical history, and the smoking states which are necessary for stroke risk assessment. Each record has a score above-average to advance health outcomes.

The dataset is designed to evaluate the feasibility of stroke prediction using various health metrics. The research explores how accurately machine learning models can predict stroke likelihood based on factors like age, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking habits.

Objective of the Dataset Collection
This dataset has been gathered to support research in predictive health analytics. The main objectives include:

Medical Decision Support – Helping healthcare professionals take data-driven steps in stroke prevention.
Risk Assessment – Identifying key health indicators linked to stroke.
Machine Learning Applications – Developing and testing prediction models for better health insights.

This dataset plays a crucial role in advancing AI-driven healthcare, with the potential to improve early diagnosis and prevention strategies.

Attribute Information:
1. id: Unique identifier for each patient.
2. gender: Categorical variable indicating the patient's gender: "Male", "Female", or "Other".
3. age: Numerical value representing the patient's age.
4. hypertension: Binary variable where 0 indicates the patient does not have hypertension, and 1 indicates the patient has hypertension.
5. heart_disease: Binary variable where 0 indicates the patient does not have any heart diseases, and 1 indicates the patient has a heart disease.
6. ever_married: Categorical variable indicating if the patient has ever been married: "No" or "Yes".
7. work_type: Categorical variable describing the patient's type of work: "children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private", or "Self-employed".
8. Residence_type: Categorical variable indicating the patient's place of residence: "Rural" or "Urban".
9. avg_glucose_level: Numerical value representing the patient's average glucose level in the blood.
10. bmi: Numerical value representing the patient's body mass index.
11. smoking_status: Categorical variable indicating the patient's smoking status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes", or "Unknown" (where "Unknown" means that the information is unavailable for this patient).
12. stroke: Binary target variable where 1 indicates the patient had a stroke, and 0 indicates the patient did not have a stroke.
This dataset is valuable for developing machine learning models aimed at predicting stroke occurrences based on various health and demographic factors. It has been utilized in studies focusing on predictive modeling and the identification of key risk factors for stroke.
