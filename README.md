Project Motivation:

Stroke is among the major causes of deaths and long-term disabilities globally. Early risk prediction of stroke would greatly improve the outcomes in patients by allowing timely medical interventions. The motivation of this project is to use machine learning techniques in analyzing health-related factors and to predict the occurrence of a stroke. By working with this dataset, we try to develop a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk.

The key goal of this dataset is to present stroke prediction abilities using health parameters. It offers machine learning models the ability to predict the   likelihood of a stroke based on input features like age, hypertension, heart disease, and smoker status.

Objective of Collecting This Dataset:
This dataset has been gathered to support the research process involved in predictive health analytics. 
Primary objectives include the following:
1. Medical Decision Support: Helping doctors and healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions regarding stroke prevention.
2. Risk Factor Analysis: Understanding how different health parameters contribute to stroke occurrence.
3. Machine Learning Applications: Training and evaluating classification models for stroke prediction.
